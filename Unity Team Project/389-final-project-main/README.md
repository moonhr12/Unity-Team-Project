# The Bears and The Bees
## About
This is the repository for our final project for CSE389. The goal of this project is to incorporate everything we have learned over the course of the semester into one video game. 
This game is basically a three-dimensional tower defesnse. You play as a bee who will do anything to defend his hives from the rabid honey-seeking brown bears. You construct flowers that shoot projectiles to kill the bears before they can get to your tower.
## Assets used for this project
### [RPG Poly Pack - Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/rpg-poly-pack-lite-148410#description)
This pack was used to set the environment of our game. It gives great lowpoly structures and natural assets. This helped us to create a good looking environment that fit the theme really well
### [Lowpoly Flowers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/plants/lowpoly-flowers-47083)
This asset gave us all the materials we needed for the flowers in our game. The flowers are used to shoot projectiles at the enemy bears.
### [Real Stars Skybox Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333)
We used this asset to get a skybox that was dark and had a lot of stars. This helped set the mood for our night level.
### [Toshi Omagari | Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code)
This is the font pack that we used for all of the UI in the game.
